Task 2 : Stopwatch Web application
As part of my internship at SkillCraft Technology, I developed a Stopwatch Web Application.The stopwatch includes core functionalities such as Start, Stop, Lap, and Reset, with proper state handling to enable or disable buttons based on usage. Lap times are displayed only when recorded, ensuring a clean and user-friendly experience. The interface is styled with the “Deep Blue Waters” color palette, providing a modern and minimal look.
